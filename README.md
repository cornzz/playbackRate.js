# What it does

This little browser extension searches every website you visit (except YouTube) for a video element and, if it finds any, starts listening for 'keydown' events, specifically for the '<' and '>' keys. Whenever one of those keys is pressed, the video is slowed down or sped up, respectively, by 0.5x.

# How to use

playbackRate.js can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/cornzz/playbackRate.js/releases) and installed manually.
